### Todo
- [ ] review installing lottie-react-native. Looks like a core dependency of this package 'lottie-ios' is being 
installed in top level node_modules, even if added to nohoist.
- [ ] Icons from react-native-vector-icons will break the app. 
Maybe related to script 'postinstall:compat:react-native-vector-icons'?
